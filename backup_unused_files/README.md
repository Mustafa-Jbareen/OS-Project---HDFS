# Backup of Unused Files

This folder is reserved for storing unused or deprecated scripts that may be needed for reference in the future.

## Purpose

When scripts become obsolete or are replaced by better implementations, they can be moved here instead of being deleted. This allows:
- Easy recovery if the old functionality is needed again
- Historical reference for understanding previous approaches
- Gradual cleanup without losing work

## Current Status

This backup folder is currently empty (aside from this README). All active scripts are in their proper locations in the main project structure.

## How to Use

If you need to archive a script:
1. Move the file to this folder
2. Update this README with the filename and reason for archiving
3. Note the date of archival

Example entry:
```
- old-script.sh (archived 2026-01-28): Replaced by new-script.sh with better error handling
```
